# Help International Students to Apply to US universities

College Search Guide is a project made by 3 freshmans at Fisk University. We are an international student from Nepal. We made this website to help our juniors, who are willing to apply to US universities; however, don't know how to start.

Being an international student it is really difficult to understand the application process because most of the high schools here in Nepal don't even talk about applying to US universities. Therefore, we came up with the idea of creating this website in order to help the students who want to have higher education in US.
